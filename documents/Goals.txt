Goal 
Build professional interactive map representing all independent active hotels in Rome (~800), as operational field tool for managing contacts and sales relationships with hotels.
Purpose
Visual monitoring and control system for leads; provide full visibility, real-time updates, and analysis of each hotel's status without losing overall city view.
Foundation 
Single database (one file, one dataset) containing all hotel data, powering two synchronized visualizations.

Full Rome View
1.	Displays all 15 Municipalities simultaneously, with boundaries clearly visible and outlined in black. (Done)
2.	Whole city of Rome fully visible; anything outside city limits dimmed or whitened (no external markers or visual elements).
3.	All hotels (~800) visible at all times; no clustering or grouping of points.
4.	Clicking Municipality or selecting from menu automatically zooms in: selected Municipality becomes only active one, others faded, non-clickable, inactive. (Done)
5.	Acts as “intelligent zoom” same map, different perspective.

Focused Municipality View
1.	Shows only selected Municipality with its hotels.
2.	Rest of city visible in transparency but inactive. (Done)
3.	Selected area centered, clearly delineated, operational focus. (Done)

Synchronization
Both views automatically synchronized; modifications (e.g., change color, add note, update status) instantly appear in other view; always same map, different ways. (Done)
Hotel Representation
Simple colored dot, no extra icons/symbols; white status (default) includes gold question mark “?” inside dot.
Colors for Lead Status: (Done)
White = not yet visited (default).
Green = positive lead.
Yellow = in negotiation.
Red = lost/negative lead.
Variants
Green/yellow include small number “1” or “2” for process phase (e.g., “Yellow 1” = first visit, “Yellow 2” = second); numbers appear on map (on pin) and in popup. (Done)
Editing: All statuses manually editable directly from map, permanently saved; no data loss after updates/reloads. (Done).
Pin Scaling
Automatically scale size by zoom (larger when zoomed in, smaller when zoomed out) for readability with 800 points. (Done)
Visibility
No automatic grouping/clustering; see every hotel individually at all times, know exact location.
Popup on Click
Simple popup with four main elements (large, clear):
  1. Star rating. (Done)
  2. Status (color name in its color, small arrow to change). (Done)
  3. Exact hotel name (official commercial name). (Done)
  4. Notes (large free-text field for full page). (Done)
Popup Additional: Smaller text for technical details (address, coordinates) below, without interfering with main part. (Done)

Filters 
1.	(work same in both views, combinable, e.g., “4-star in Municipality II”).
2.	Municipality (one at a time, via click/dropdown). (Done)
3.	Star category (1★–5★). (Done)
Map Style
1.	Outside Rome: completely white/gray, non-clickable.
2.	Inside Rome: only hotel points, no other elements (no restaurants, shops, stations, icons).
3.	Optionally: names of main neighborhoods in small text.
4.	Municipality borders: black, thick, always visible on full-city map. (Done)
5.	Basemap: clean, modern, minimalistic; developer shows 2–3 styles for choice.
6.	Final Product: Real operational management tool/field-work platform; every point is actively worked hotel.
Purposes
Display all leads clearly/coherently.
Know real-time status of each.
Manually update field progress (colors, notes, statuses).
Quickly filter/view by type/area.
Maintain complete, synchronized, real-time overview of city.
Performance: No lag/slowdown; perfectly smooth, responsive, stable with 800 points, on desktop/mobile.
Development 
Provide direct live link/file for real-time progress view; client tests continuously on mobile/desktop for design, functionality, sizing, responsiveness, usability; immediate feedback.
Delivery
Entire project (code, database, all technical/administrative access) exclusive client property; no developer/third-party access, credentials, modification/view ability post-delivery; fully client-controlled, no dependencies/locks/permissions.
